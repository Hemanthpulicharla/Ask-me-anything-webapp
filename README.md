#Welcome to the Ask Me Anything (AMA) web app repository!

This repository contains the code for an AMA web app that utilizes the OpenAI API to provide intelligent responses to user questions. The app is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenAI API, and is designed to be easy to use and navigate.

To use the app, simply type in a question in the input field and click the "Ask" button. The app will then use the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the question, which will be displayed on the page. The app is capable of answering a wide range of questions, from simple queries to more complex topics.


Thanks!!
